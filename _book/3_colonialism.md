Self-mythologizing around the fire quickly became part of the narrative around the city, comparing the event to the Chicago fire as an example of the city founder's "indomitable energy" and thanking the "rich men who came forward, and by their actions and liberal use of money inspired the confidence to make a city."

This booster rhetoric celebrated American resilience while obscuring the transnational nature of the reconstruction financing. The narrative of local determination masked the reality of foreign dependency.

The visual documentation of the fire's aftermath served both as historical record and promotional material, reinforcing the story of Spokane's triumphant rebirth.
