Contrary to both local booster narratives and traditional understandings of the post-Monroe Doctrine era, this paper argues that Spokane development was not only a story of American enterprise but a complex case of overlapping colonialism.

The integration of Dutch capital into Spokane's economy demonstrates how economic relationships transcended political boundaries and ideological commitments. These connections created hybrid forms of development that don't fit neatly into national narratives.

Understanding this history requires acknowledging the multinational dimensions of western expansion and the ways local identities were shaped by global economic forces.
