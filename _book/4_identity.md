Not included in this narrative was the fact that a small syndicate of Dutch financiers lent most of the capital involved in this rebuilding. This mortgage lending led to Dutch interests owning twenty-five percent of Spokane, including most of its downtown by 1896, after falling into receivership. At the time, the company urged discretion with this information, as they feared their identity would be interpreted as a foreign-owned monopoly by "western radicals" in Spokane.

The tension between local identity and foreign control created a complex dynamic that shaped Spokane's development trajectory. Public narratives emphasized American enterprise while private arrangements revealed international interdependence.

This pattern of concealed foreign investment challenges traditional understandings of western expansion as purely domestic enterprise.
