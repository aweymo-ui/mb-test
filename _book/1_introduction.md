In a full-page feature on January 31, 1931, Amsterdam's Algemeen Handelsblad hailed Spokane, Washington, as &ldquo;The Playground of the Nation.&rdquo; The tagline continued, &ldquo;originally a trading post&mdash;Dutch bankers helped make the city great&mdash;wheat, apples, metals, and &lsquo;white coal,&rsquo;&rdquo; referencing the hydropower of Spokane Falls that was so central to Dutch interests. The article asked readers to &ldquo;pronounce the name: Spokhin, not Spo-keen, as you learned in school,&rdquo; suggesting that the paper's Dutch readership would have a longstanding familiarity with the Washington city. The author goes on to reference a popular joke between blackface characters Rastus and Sam performed in European music halls. &ldquo;&lsquo;Where is Spokane located&rsquo; asks Rastus to Sam. The answer was: &lsquo;Somewhere in Holland&rsquo;. Loud applause, everyone understood the joke. Because enterprising banks from the Netherlands were godparents at the birth of the new town in the Northwest of America.&rdquo;

On August 4th 1889, a fire destroyed thirty-two blocks of downtown Spokane, effectively sweeping &ldquo;the entire business portion of the city&rdquo; away.

Self-mythologizing around the fire quickly became part of the narrative around the city, comparing the event to the Chicago fire as an example of the city founder's &ldquo;indomitable energy&rdquo; and thanking the &ldquo;rich men who came forward, and by their actions and liberal use of money inspired the confidence to make a city.&rdquo;

Not included in this narrative was the fact that a small syndicate of Dutch financiers lent most of the capital involved in this rebuilding.

This mortgage lending led to Dutch interests owning twenty-five percent of Spokane, including most of its downtown by 1896, after falling into receivership. At the time, the company urged discretion with this information, as they feared their identity would be interpreted as a foreign-owned monopoly by &ldquo;western radicals&rdquo; in Spokane.

Contrary to both local booster narratives and traditional understandings of the post-Monroe Doctrine era, this paper argues that Spokane development was not only a story of American enterprise but a complex case of overlapping colonialism. It contends that the settler colonial ambitions of American industrialists were supplanted by the predatory financial schemes and land acquisition of Dutch interests. This interest, originating with the new Dutch merchant class created by the 1870s Cape Era diamond boom, flowed into American railway bonds and ultimately established a foreign-controlled financial market in Spokane. Between the fire of 1889 and the liquidation of Dutch assets in 1923, Spokane's aggressive public display of frontier iconography was less an expression of civic pride than a cultural assertion of an American identity designed to obscure its complicated, foreign financial relationships.
