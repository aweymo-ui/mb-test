On August 4th 1889, a fire destroyed thirty-two blocks of downtown Spokane, effectively sweeping "the entire business portion of the city" away. The disaster created both crisis and opportunity, attracting investment from unexpected sources.

Dutch newspapers like De Grondwet covered the fire extensively, reflecting the financial community's interest in the region's recovery prospects. This international attention signaled the beginning of significant European capital inflow.

The rebuilding effort became a showcase for how disaster could catalyze new economic relationships, drawing investors who saw potential where others saw only loss.
